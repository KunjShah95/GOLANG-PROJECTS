# HTTP Traffic Sniffer

This project is a simple HTTP traffic sniffer written in Go. It logs incoming HTTP requests based on specified filters and rate limits. The log files are rotated based on size to ensure manageability.

## Features

- Rate limits the logging to prevent excessive log entries.
- Rotates log files when they exceed a specified size (5MB).
