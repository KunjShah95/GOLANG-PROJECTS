# 🚀 API Gateway

An API Gateway is a crucial architectural component for managing and routing API requests in microservices architectures. This project demonstrates how to implement an API Gateway in **Go (Golang)** that handles request routing, load balancing, security, and more.

## 📖 Project Overview

The **API Gateway** project provides a scalable and flexible solution for managing API requests in a microservices environment. The API Gateway handles:

- **Request Routing:** Routes incoming client requests to the appropriate service based on defined routes.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple instances of a service to ensure high availability.
- **Security:** Implements authentication, authorization, and rate-limiting mechanisms.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Collects metrics and logs for tracking system performance.

This implementation is built with **Go (Golang)**, leveraging its high performance and scalability for efficient API request management.

## 💡 Features

- 🔄 **Request Routing**: Directs requests to the appropriate microservice.
- ⚖️ **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly for better resource utilization.
- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**: Supports secure API access with JWT or OAuth tokens.
- 🛡️ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per client.
- 🔄 **Fault Tolerance**: Handles failures gracefully by retrying or forwarding requests to healthy services.
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Tracks API usage, errors, and service health.

## ⚙️ Installation

To set up the API Gateway, follow these steps:

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Go (Golang)](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed on your machine (version 1.18 or above).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/KunjShah95/API-GATEWAY.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd API-GATEWAY

3. Install Go dependencies:

   go mod tidy

4. Start the API Gateway:

   go run main.go

5. The API Gateway should now be running locally at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 💻 Usage

Once the API Gateway is running, you can make requests to it, and it will route those requests to the appropriate microservices.

### Example Request:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/service-name

For authentication, include the necessary JWT token in the request header:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/service-name -H "Authorization: Bearer <Your-JWT-Token>"

## 🔧 Configuration

The API Gateway is highly configurable through the `config/` directory or environment variables. Key configuration settings include:

- **Service Routes:** Define the mapping of client requests to microservices.
- **Authentication:** Configure JWT or OAuth tokens for securing endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting:** Set rate limits for different services or endpoints.

For detailed configuration options, please check the `config/` directory.
